# Test-Project

Before running tests PyCharm should be installed (see requirements.txt) also 
  - nose
  - python
  
To run 1st task run ' python split_file_output.py ' in root project folder (f1.txt is a file with data to work with)
To run 2nd task run ' nosetests -v -s --nologcapture ./tests/test_sample_scenario.py ' command in root project folder. For this task CSS locator is used for 1 case (1 search element), probably needs to be implemented through parent element-child element constructions, which is better work for JAVA
To run 3rd task run python minimum_number.py
